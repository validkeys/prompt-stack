# Create Continuation Prompt

A meta-prompt for generating effective continuation prompts that help resume AI conversations with full context.

## Purpose

Use this prompt when you need to create a continuation prompt that will allow you to resume an AI session while preserving important context, decisions, and progress from previous conversations.

## The Prompt

```
I need to create a continuation prompt for resuming my AI session. Please analyze our current conversation and generate a comprehensive continuation prompt that includes:

1. **Context Summary**: A brief overview of what we've been working on
2. **Key Decisions**: Important choices or approaches we've agreed upon
3. **Current State**: Where we are in the project/task
4. **Active Links**: Any relevant file paths, URLs, or references that are important
5. **Next Steps**: What needs to happen next
6. **Important Notes**: Any specific requirements, constraints, or preferences to remember

Format the output as a ready-to-use prompt that I can copy and paste into a new session to seamlessly continue our work.
```

## Usage Example

Simply paste this prompt when you're approaching the end of a session or when you want to create a checkpoint before switching contexts.

## Output Format

The generated continuation prompt should be self-contained and include all necessary context for another AI instance (or yourself in a future session) to pick up exactly where you left off.

## Tips

- Use this proactively before context limits are reached
- Include this early in long projects to create checkpoints
- Update continuation prompts as major decisions or milestones are reached
- Store generated prompts in a notes app or project documentation
