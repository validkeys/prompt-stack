# Prompt Library

A curated collection of AI prompts, workflows, and prompt patterns for effective AI-assisted development and problem-solving.

## Purpose

This library serves as a personal knowledge base of proven prompts and workflows that enhance productivity when working with AI assistants. Each prompt is documented with its purpose, usage instructions, and practical tips based on real-world application.

## Structure

### `/workflows`
Structured multi-step processes for complex tasks that require systematic approaches. These workflows enforce discipline and ensure thorough documentation.

Examples:
- Bug reporting and resolution workflow
- Implementation planning with requirements gathering
- Feature development process
- Code review procedures

### `/commands`
Reusable prompt templates for specific tasks. These are ready-to-use prompts that can be copy-pasted or integrated into AI assistant configurations.

Examples:
- Continuation prompt generation
- Project setup templates
- Documentation generators

### `/prompt-decorations`
Patterns and techniques for enhancing prompts with better context, constraints, or formatting to get more accurate and useful responses.

### `/rules`
Guidelines and standards to follow when creating content, documentation, or code. These rules ensure consistency and optimize for AI comprehension.

Examples:
- AI-optimized documentation guidelines
- Code style standards
- Naming conventions

## How to Use

1. **Browse**: Explore folders to find prompts relevant to your current task
2. **Copy**: Use the documented prompts as-is or adapt them to your needs
3. **Integrate**: Add frequently-used prompts to your AI assistant's command configuration
4. **Iterate**: Update and refine prompts based on results and evolving needs

## Contributing to Your Library

As you discover new effective prompts or workflows:

1. Document the prompt with clear purpose and usage instructions
2. Include examples of when to use (and when not to use) the prompt
3. Add tips based on practical experience
4. Use consistent formatting for easy scanning

## Philosophy

Good prompts are:
- **Specific**: Clear about what they do and when to use them
- **Structured**: Organized format that produces consistent results
- **Reusable**: Generic enough to apply across multiple situations
- **Documented**: Include context on why they work and how to adapt them

## Maintenance

Regularly review and:
- Remove prompts that no longer provide value
- Update prompts that have been refined through use
- Add new prompts as effective patterns emerge
- Reorganize as the library grows
