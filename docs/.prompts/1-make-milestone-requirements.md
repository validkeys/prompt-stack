Next Milestone: M1

We are working on a multi-milestone project that uses ralphy for iterative development.
We are currently in phase 1, using ralphy to generate hardended implementation plan (not code).

Please review:

* Project Requirements: `/Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/requirements/main.md`
* Architecture: `/Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/requirements/architecture.md`
* Milestones: `/Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/requirements/milestones.md`
* Complete Document Index: `/Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/index.md`

Steps:

- Interview me one question at a time tracking each question and answer in `/Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/implementation-plan/m{n}/requirements-interview.md`
- Once you have enough information, use that information and any other other context documents to generate our milestone requirements document. Here is a template: `/Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/templates/planning-phase.input.yaml`. Place the requirements document in:`/Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/implementation-plan/m{n}/requirements.md`

Please repeat back the end goal, the steps you will take and the documents you will use for reference before interviewing me.
