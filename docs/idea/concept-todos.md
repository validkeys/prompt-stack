1. I'd like to brainstorm on what a "PR" to our OS looks like. A few scenarios:

- Domain tax expert gets updating information that requires a change to our current knowledge that doesn't require a code change
- Domain expoert has knowledge change that does require how the product works
- Product owner has idea for new feature
- Product manager finds a bug
- System architect wants to reorganize/refactor the System
- Developer wants to refactor code, add new code features

2. Right now typically an orgainization but have a table in their data for witholding tax rates (as an example). Is there a way for the knowledge graph to act as our database so that we aren't capturing this information in multiple places? Is there something to the way notion has "blocks" in their documents and one of those blocks is itself a database.
