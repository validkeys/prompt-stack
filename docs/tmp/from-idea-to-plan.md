# Docs:

- Initial Requirements: /Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/requirements/main.md
- Docs Index: /Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/index.md


- [x] Analyze /Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/requirements/main.md, then interview me one question at at time tracking the Q&A in requirements/interview.md
- [x] Create a final requirements document adding the insights gained from the interview into one final document (not an implementation plan, just a clear business requirements document)
- [x] Ask me some quesetions about how I want to implement this (language, tools, patterns etc..) abd place this document in requirements/architecture.md. I'd like to define a pluggable architecture for this as we will be wanting to add new functionality as well as extend existing functionality in the near future. Use the same one-question-at-a-time interview style to generate the architecture plan.
- [x] Then let's discuss project milestones, how to break this down into individual milestones then create docs/requirements/milestones.md
- [x] Then create requirements/index.md as an entry point referencing all of our requirements documents
- [ ] Create folder, implementation
- [ ] Create the initial ralphy yaml tasks document as our implementation plan in implementation/prd.yaml. It should follow all of the best practices from /Users/kyledavis/Sites/prompt-stack/docs/report.md and break down tasks to be as granular as possible.
- [ ] Give me the ralphy command to run this
- [ ] Let's see what we get!
